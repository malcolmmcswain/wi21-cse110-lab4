1. The last value assigned to i will be printed because, since it was declared as a var, it exists inside the function scope
2. The last value assigned to discountedPrice will be printed because it also exists inside the function scope
3. The last value assigned to finalPrice will be printed as it was declared in the function scope
4. The function will return an array containing the price after discount of each price from the parameter array of prices
5. The function would throw an error, since let variables only exist in the scope of the block they're declared in
6. The function would also throw an error as discountedPrice was also declared in the for loop block
7. The last value assigned to finalPrice will be printed since it was declared in the function scope
8. The function will return the same array from question 4 since let declarations are mutable
9. The function would throw an error, since let variables only exist in the scope of the block they're declared in
10. The first value assigned to discountedPrice would be printed since it can't be changed after its declaration
11. 0 would be printed because it is also a const
12. The function would return an empty array because the local variable used as the return value was also declared as a const
13A. student.name
13B. student['Grad Year']
13C. student.greeting()
13D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
13E. student.courseLoad[1]
14A. '32' because the + is interpreted as concatenation following a string
14B. 1 because the - is a mathematical operation, so '3' is automatically converted to 3
14C
